A web app to display lectures of the [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) for a given time and day.

It uses my [personal API](https://github.com/MatthiasHarzer/personal_api) to retrieve parsed events from the [KIT extended search](https://campus.kit.edu/sp/campus/all/extendedSearch.asp) endpoint formatted as json (the KIT endpoint is kinda trash and only returns a prerendered HTML page).
